00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:21,706
Oh‚ hush‚ my dear‚ It is
been a difficult year

2
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:27,803
And terrors don′t prey
on innocent victims

3
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:34,416
Trust me‚ darlin′‚ trust me darlin′

4
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,501
It is been a loveless year

5
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,208
I am a man of three fears

6
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:48,917
Integrity‚ faith‚ and crocodile tears

7
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:55,400
Trust me‚ darlin′‚ trust me‚ darlin′

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,599
So look me in the eyes (Eyes)‚ tell
me what you see (You see)

9
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:09,106
Perfect paradise (Dise)‚ tearin′
at the seams (Seams)

10
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:14,411
I wish I could escape it (Escape)‚
I don′t wanna fake it

11
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:19,316
Wish I could erase it (Erase)‚
make your heart believe

12
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:25,317
But I am a bad liar‚ bad liar

13
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,308
Now you know‚ now you know

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,899
I am a bad liar‚ bad liar

00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:42,204
Now you know‚ You are free to go

16
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:48,007
Did all my dreams never
mean one thing?

17
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:53,306
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?

18
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,309
Oh‚ I have been askin′ for

19
00:01:56,405 --> 00:02:03,104
Oh‚ I have been askin′ for problems‚
problems‚ problems

20
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:09,503
I wage my war‚ on the world inside

21
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:15,218
I take my gun to the enemy′s side

22
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:18,003
Oh‚ I have been askin′ for
(Trust me‚ darlin′)

23
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:24,718
Oh‚ I have been askin′ for
(Trust me‚ darlin′) problems‚
problems‚ problems

24
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:29,813
So look me in the eyes (Eyes)‚ tell
me what you see (You see)

00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:35,312
Perfect paradise (Dise)‚ tearin′
at the seams (Seams)

Now you know‚ You are free to go

00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:14,213
I can′t breathe‚ I can′t be

33
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:21,200
I can′t be what you want me to be

34
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,909
Believe me‚ this one time
